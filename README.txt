Breakthrough Game AI – CS591 Project
This project is a Pygame-based implementation of the Breakthrough board game featuring intelligent AI opponents powered by Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms,
each using different offensive and defensive heuristics. Heuristics 2 was created by me.

What's Inside
Two-player game simulation (Player vs AI or AI vs AI)

Customizable heuristic options

Matchup modes to compare different AI strategies

Step-by-step performance output after each game

Requirements
->You only need to install one dependency:

In your terminal:
->pip install pygame

How to Run
->Once Pygame is installed, run the game using:

->python breakthroughgame.py

->Make sure all required .py files (like minimax_agent.py) are in the same folder.

Files
->breakthroughgame.py – Main Pygame GUI and controller
->minimax_agent.py – AI algorithms and heuristics
