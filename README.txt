Breakthrough Game AI – CS591 Project
This project is a Pygame-based implementation of the Breakthrough board game featuring intelligent AI opponents powered by Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms, each using different offensive and defensive heuristics.

What's Inside
Two-player game simulation (Player vs AI or AI vs AI)

Customizable heuristic options

Matchup modes to compare different AI strategies

Step-by-step performance output after each game

Requirements
You only need to install one dependency:

In your terminal:
pip install pygame

How to Run
Once Pygame is installed, run the game using:

python breakthroughgame.py

Make sure all required .py files (like minimax_agent.py) are in the same folder.

📁 Files
breakthroughgame.py – Main Pygame GUI and controller
minimax_agent.py – AI algorithms and heuristics
